HOW TO INSTALL



1.) Gather all source files
This should be the easiest step. All source files should already
be included. If this is not the case, try cloning/forking the git
directory from:
https://github.com/danielkleebinder/linuxmailsockets
for example.


2.) Creating the executables
There should now be two directories available (at least) called
"server/" and "client/". Both contain so called "Makefiles" which
allow for compilation on Linux systems.

Use the command "make" in your bash to create the executable
files. Make sure that you are already in either the "client/" or the
"server/" directory! Both applications (server and client) need to
be compiled separately!


3.) Running the application
Use the command "./<application-name> <param-1> <param-2> ..." to
run the program. This will work for both client and server. Please
check the servers help-page for further information about parameters
and possible errors which may occur!


4.) Contact
